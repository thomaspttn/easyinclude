Easy, like Sunday morning...

## What?
Compiling code in C/C++ is already difficult, and attempting to cross-compile C/C++ is a modern logistical nightmare. The most common solutions for this issue are to use a tool like `Docker` to do your cross-compilation and this indeed often solves the problem. But how do you deal with editing your code and having features like linting and autocompletion work out well? You could use something like VSCode's Remote Containers plugin or a script I wrote to use Neovim inside Docker.
